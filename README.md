Automation Live Status tracking app Android

This is the companion android app of the Selenium Plug and Play Framework.

The features of the app are:

1. Configure broker from the app.
2. Live status display in the app.


N.B. : There are a lot of bugs, I will be trying to fix them as and when I find time. But the basic app works.
